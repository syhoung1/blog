title: My start in programming
---

If I'm being honest, learning to program had never been something I've shown any 
love or interest towards. To clarify, it's not the case that I actively avoided 
computers and programming, the idea of learning about them just never really 
occurred to me. I dipped my toes into the world of progrmaming by partaking back
in August in a 30 days of code tutorial offered by HackerRank, and if we are 
still practicing honest and full disclosure, that experience only lasted about 
20 days. 

The tutorial itself offered plenty of examples and explanations of basic computer
science fundamentals as well as some higher level abstractions of how the java 
data structure works. However, as is the issue with learning any new language,
nearly every word they uttered seemed like a foreign word. I've practiced using
English for twenty something years and I'd like to claim that I'm competent in my 
handling and understanding of this language, so how could something written and 
spoken in English be so damned confounding?! Here's a line from one of the challenges 
offered at the end of each tutorial:

"Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);"

What the hell. Herein lies one of many, many frustrations that arise while 
learning to code. I understand now that for clarity's sake they named the scanner 
object scan so that there's no confusion about what's calling the method when 
they introduce "scan.nextLine()," but when you're first starting out learning 
how to read code, that's just all gibberish.

Of course, there is a learning curve for anything that's worthwhile to be 
educated in. English was not my first language, but following years of practice
and development I have come to love writing with it, most of English is not 
confusing anymore, and I know at my best I could write at a collegiate level. 
The goal is, in learning how to code, that I will become competent enough at it 
to be able to claim it and love it as my third language.
