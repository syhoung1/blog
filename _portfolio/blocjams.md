# The App #

## An iOS compatible music player ##
BlocJams lets you play music from the browser or from the phone and was designed with iOS compatibility in mind.

## What I did ##
My role in this app was to simplify the code in this application which had previously relied heavily on the DOM.

## Simplifying ##
The first iteration of the blocJams app was written in plain javascript and the code was bulky as a result.

## Converting to Angular ##
Using the Angular framework to dictate the view of the app significantly cut down on the number of lines of code needed to create the same functional application. 

## Angular for manageability ##
As this was my first project building in Angular, it was shocking how much code could be simplified.
