# The App #

## A simplified chat app ##
BlocChat is a functional and minimalist chat room application that allows users to communicate with text via the browser. 

## My role ##
I was responsible for constructing the basic elements needed in order for a chat room to function. I constructed a list of available chat rooms, the field in which to enter text, and the display of texts in a chat room.

## Updating data to show text ##
Messages needed to be appended to the list of messages in the room and displayed immediately.

## Using Angular and firebase ##
Firebase was utilized to contain and index all the rooms and messages associated with the application. In order to update the view for the user, the angular framework allowed us to take data from firebase and display changes immediately using two way data binding.

## Still to come ##
This application is a good foundation to build off of. Features could be included in the future in order to expand functionality and improve user experience.
